        #            WARNING: BREAKING CHANGES IN UPCOMING VERSION `v1.0.0`            #
        #                                                                              #

        # This formula currently provides two methods for managing Fail2Ban; the old   #
        # method under `fail2ban` and the new method under `fail2ban.ng`. In upcoming  #
        # `v1.0.0`, the old method will be removed and `fail2ban.ng` will be promoted  #
        # to `fail2ban` in its place.                                                  #
        #                                                                              #
        # If you are not in a position to migrate, you will need to pin your repo to   #
        # the final release tag before `v1.0.0`, which is expected to be `v0.17.2`.    #
        #                                                                              #
        # If you are currently using `fail2ban.ng`, there is nothing to do until       #
        # `v1.0.0` is released.                                                        #

        # To migrate from the old `fail2ban`, the first step is to convert to          #
        # `fail2ban.ng`, before `v1.0.0` is released.                                  #
